# phptemplate
A basic template for php

This template handles:
1: A basic MVC structure with working examples of a login/logout/select user page and other functions to access database
2: Database access using sql (phpmyadmin)
3: A basic design for all the styles and project visual structure
4: Access to icons using fontAwesome 5
5: Access to bootstrap 5
6: A shopping cart defined structure (need to be implemented to work)
7: Datatables access (need to be implemented to work)
8: Messages to the user when performing a task to inform them about the results using sweetAlert

The whole point of this structure is to use it for future php projects without the need to creating the whole project from 0, this will help create a basic structure for all my projects and updated with last used tech from third_party utilities.
